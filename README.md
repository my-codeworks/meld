# Meld

Simple merge backend for text with a common ancestor.

This gem aims to provide a decoupled implementation of just the merging of versions. The assumption is that the versions have a common root.

It takes three instances of textblocks, BASE, THIS and OTHER and returns a hash of conflicts or a merged result.

## Examples

Lets look at some examples

### Nothing changed

Given three texts, all identical in content, returns the base's content

```ruby
base = this = other = %Q{
  Lorem ipsum
}

Meld.new( base: base, this: this, other: other)

# -> { result: "Lorem ipsum" }
```

### THIS or OTHER added to

Given three texts, where THIS or OTHER has additional content over the other two, return the text with additional content

```ruby
base = other = %Q{
  Lorem ipsum
}

this_added = other + " dolor sit amet"

Meld.new( base: base, this: this_added, other: other)

# -> { result: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" }
```

### THIS and OTHER added to

Given three texts, where THIS and OTHER has additional content over base, return a new text with the additional content merged

```ruby
base = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #f00;
  }
]

this = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #f00;
  }

  .blue {
    color: #00f;
  }
]

this = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #f00;
  }

  .green {
    color: #0f0;
  }
]

Meld.new( base: base, this: this, other: other)

# -> { result: ".red {\n  color: #f00;\n}\n\n.blue {\n  color: #00f;\n}\n\n.green {\n  color: #0f0;\n}" }
```

### Conflicting changes

Given three text, where THIS and OTHER has both changed base in different ways, return a hash of all the conflicts and an empty result

```ruby
base = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #f00;
  }
]

this = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #00f;
  }
]

this = %Q[
  .red {
    color: #0f0;
  }
]

Meld.new( base: base, this: this, other: other)

# -> { conflict: {this: {start: [2,10], end: [2,13]}, other: {start: [2,10], end: [2,12]}}, result: "" }
```
